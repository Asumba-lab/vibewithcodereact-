This project is a simple React component showcase. It includes several reusable UI components, each in its own file, and a live demo page to see them in action.

## Components

- **Counter**: A counter with increment and decrement buttons.
- **LikeButton**: A button that triggers a like action.
- **Message**: Displays a message and its author.
- **UserCard**: Shows a user's avatar, name, and email.
- **DarkModeComponent**: Displays a box styled for dark or light mode with a toggle.

cd vibewithcodereact-
```

### 2. Install dependencies

### 3. Run the app locally
```sh
npm start
```
This will start the development server at (https://vibewithcodereact-ty1i.vercel.app/).

### 4. Build for production
